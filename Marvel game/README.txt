How to launch the program:

Select the MarvelUniverse class to play the whole program. 

Individual GUI testings can be found in the RaceWindow and FinalScreen classes (two other GUI window objects 
tested through their respective main menus)

One Change:

The program ends after all players cross the finish line. This is so that the race is more "realistic" in a sense that 
a podium could be displayed and a position awarded after the race is completed as all MarvelHero objects would have 
crossed the finish line.
